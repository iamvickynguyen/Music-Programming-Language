# Synthtax ( :construction: under construction :construction: )

Synthtax is a dynamically typed, imperative music programming language designed for creating and manipulating sound. This minimal language is able to supports some programming constructs such as loops, conditionals, and function calls. Synthtax provides a mechanism to generate and modify sound, specifically, oscillators and ADSR. The language is implemented as a C++ transpiler using the C++ programming language and ANTLR.

See [Synthtax examples](test/)

## How to run

1. `./generate.sh` : generate lexer, parser, visitor classes
2. `cmake -S ./ -B build` : create build
3. `cd build; make` : compile and link
4. `./synthtax <filename>` : run the file

## Goals

1. Worst case: Show the AST generated by ANTLR with the Synthtax grammar, and show how sound can be generated with `RTAudio` library
2. Expected: The program can produce C++ code and link with the Synthtax built-in C++ code, and it can generate sound
3. Stretch: Expand Synthtax capabilities such as adding arrays and user defined objects, and some digital processing concepts such as subtractive synthesis, frequency modulation, and getting MIDI input.

## TODO

1. Implement AST. Print C++ syntax
2. Write functions to generate Osicalltors and play sound with `RTAudio`
3. Documentation
